How to use Scoreboard
- Hit the “Setup Info” to enter player names and the game details
- Colour and font size can be adjusted via the separate buttons
- Hit “0” or press the Swap hammer button to change the current shooter
- Update the scoreboard following each shot by either typing a 1 (no 20), 2 (20 scored) or 9 (opponent 20 scored). The scoreboard and “next shot” indicator change automatically.
- After all the shots have been taken, press 4, 5 or 6 to allocate the points for the round. After that key-stroke the scoreboard resets and you are back to entering 1, 2 or 9 for each shot.
- There’s no save or undo options. Refreshing the page wipes out the score.
- After the match is done, hit “Download Table” (near the match log). This creates a csv file which can produce the scoreboard using a PPT macro.
